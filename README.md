## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is my first project of the nanodegree Data Scientist on Udacity, and for this project, I was interested in using Airbnb quarterly data set to better understand:

1. What is the most expansive neighbourhood in Rio de Janeiro?
2. What time of the year has the higher rental prices?
3. What features that influence the property pricing?
4. How are the listings distributed on Rio de Janeiro?
5. How to choose a model to try predict the price of Rio's listings?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

### [Select relevant information and basic data-cleaning](https://github.com/zaninth/AirbnbRioDeJaneiro/blob/main/1%20Relevant%20information%20and%20basic%20data%20cleaning.ipynb)

- Selection of relevant features and columns.
- Elimination of unpleasant characters and correction of data types.
- Removing neighbourhood column and renaming neighbourhood_cleansed column to neighbourhood, beacuse there was where the real data was stored.
- Cleaning the feature amenities and creating a little barchart to try out understand the amenites column. 

### [Data Understanding & Preparation](https://github.com/zaninth/AirbnbRioDeJaneiro/blob/main/2%20Data%20understanding%20and%20Data%20preparation.ipynb)

- Identifying outliers on princing and how they will affect analyses.
- Histograms of the price and the price per accommodate.
- Percentage of null values in numerical and categorical features.
- Histograms of numerical features.
- Number of data points per category in categorical features.
- Creation of the variable price for accommodation.
- Elimination of variables with more than 95% of null values.
- Filling in the null values with the median in numerical characteristics.
- Filling in the null values with the mode in categorical characteristics.
- Extract month from dates column anda preparation from Calendar data.
- Removing adjusted_price column and using only price, to better formart the model, and trying to avoid confusions.
- Detection and elimination of outliers with IQR.
