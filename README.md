## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb quarterly data for the last year to better understand:

1. What is the most expansive neighbourhoods in Rio de Janeiro?
2. What time of the year has the higher rental price?
3. What are the Features that most influence the property pricing?
4. How are the listings distributeds on Rio de Janeiro?
5. How to chose a model to predict pricing on listings?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 6 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional notebook file ('COMPLETE.ipynb') that contains all the parts together.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](link of medium).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Inside Airbnb get link available [here](http://insideairbnb.com).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
